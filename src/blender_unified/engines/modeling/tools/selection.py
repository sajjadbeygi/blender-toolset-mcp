"""MCP tools for selecting part of a mesh.

Every mesh editing handler used to select the whole mesh before acting, so
"bevel the top edge" or "inset the front face" could not be expressed and
sixteen tools quietly did their job to everything.

Selection is not state this server invents. Blender keeps it on the mesh data
as vertex, edge and polygon select flags: it survives leaving edit mode,
survives deselecting the object, and is saved in the .blend. These tools set
it, and the mesh tools read it when asked to.

bpy.ops.mesh.loop_select is deliberately absent. It requires a view3d region
and a click position, so over a socket it always fails.
