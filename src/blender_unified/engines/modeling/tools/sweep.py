    Use this for anything that follows a route: hoses, handrails, wires, vines,
    tentacles, roads. It orients the profile with parallel transport, so the
    tube never creases or folds where the path turns vertical, and it reports
    whether any bend is too tight for the profile to fit around.

    Args:
        path_points: Centreline as a list of [x, y, z] points, in order. At
            least 2, at most 2000. Consecutive points must differ.
        profile: Cross-section shape - CIRCLE, SQUARE, HEXAGON, or TRIANGLE.
        radius: Distance from the centreline to the furthest point of the
            profile, in Blender units. Must be positive.
        sides: Number of sides for a CIRCLE profile (3-1024). Ignored by the
            fixed-sided profiles.
        resolution: Samples generated between each pair of path points, which
            smooths the path with a centripetal Catmull-Rom spline. 0 uses the
            points exactly as given. 8-16 gives a smooth curve.
        twist: Total rotation of the profile about the path from start to end,
            in radians. Spreads evenly along the path.
        caps: Close both ends. Leave True for a printable solid.
        name: Name for the created object.

    Returns:
        Dict with the object name, vertex and face counts, and a validity
        report: min_clearance_ratio (path curvature radius over profile radius
        at the tightest point), tightest_point, and self_intersects. A ratio
        below 1.0 means rings overlap inside the bend, so the result is
        watertight but is not a solid.
