        "The Bool Tool auto operations handle selection, cleanup, and cutter removal automatically.\n"
        "- Use `booltool_auto_union` to permanently merge meshes (e.g., joining a head to a body "
        "so parts don't float apart).\n"
        "- Use `booltool_auto_difference` for cutting holes or subtracting shapes.\n"
        "- Use `booltool_auto_intersect` to keep only overlapping geometry.\n"
        "- Use `booltool_auto_slice` to split an object along another shape.\n"
        "- Only use the lower-level `boolean_operation` or `add_modifier(type='BOOLEAN')` when "
        "you need non-destructive (unapplied) boolean modifiers.\n\n"
        "## Mesh Editing\n"
        "- Use `bridge_edge_loops` to connect two edge loops with faces — great for "
        "connecting limbs, creating tubes, or joining mesh islands.\n"
        "- Use `merge_vertices` to clean up overlapping vertices after boolean or join operations.\n"
        "- Use `set_smooth_shading` after modeling to improve visual quality.\n"
        "- Apply `subdivide_mesh` before detailed sculpting for more geometry.\n\n"
        "## Modifiers\n"
        "- Add modifiers with `add_modifier`, configure with `set_modifier_property`, "
        "and finalize with `apply_modifier`.\n"
        "- Common workflow: MIRROR modifier for symmetric modeling, then SUBSURF for smoothing.\n"
        "- Use `remove_modifier` to discard unwanted modifiers without applying.\n\n"
        "## General Workflow\n"
        "- Always check the scene state with the blender://scene resource before making assumptions.\n"
        "- Use `apply_transform` before boolean operations to avoid unexpected results from "
        "unapplied scale/rotation.\n"
        "- Organize objects into collections for complex scenes.\n"
        "- Name objects descriptively — many tools reference objects by name.\n"

        "### Quad Topology\n"
        "- Always prefer quads (4-sided polygons) over triangles or n-gons.\n"
        "- Quads deform predictably during animation and subdivide cleanly.\n"
        "- Avoid triangles in areas of high curvature or deformation (joints, face).\n"
        "- N-gons (5+ sided faces) cause unpredictable shading artifacts — always clean up.\n\n"
        "### Edge Loops and Edge Flow\n"
        "- Edge loops should follow the natural contours and muscle lines of the subject.\n"
        "- For characters: edge loops around eyes, mouth, and joints are critical for deformation.\n"
        "- Edge flow determines how the mesh deforms during animation — plan it before modeling.\n"
        "- Use Ctrl+R (Loop Cut) to insert edge loops; Alt+click to select entire loops.\n\n"
        "### Poles\n"
        "- A pole is a vertex where more or fewer than 4 edges meet.\n"
        "- 3-poles and 5-poles are sometimes necessary but should be placed in low-curvature areas.\n"
        "- Avoid 5+ edge poles in areas that will deform (joints, face muscles).\n"
        "- Use poles to redirect edge flow when transitioning between areas of different density.\n\n"
        "### Modifiers vs Direct Editing\n"
        "- Use the Mirror modifier (X axis) for symmetric modeling — apply only when done.\n"
        "- Use Subdivision Surface modifier to smooth mesh — keep base mesh low-poly and clean.\n"
        "- Use Bevel modifier for rounded edges instead of manually loop-cutting bevels.\n"
        "- Apply modifiers only when the mesh is finalized; keep them live for flexibility.\n\n"
        "### N-gon Cleanup\n"
        "- Use Grid Fill (F after selecting border edge loop) to fill holes with clean quads.\n"
        "- Use Triangulate modifier only as a last resort for export (games, rendering).\n"
        "- F3 → 'Tris to Quads' (Alt+J) can auto-convert many triangles back to quads.\n\n"
        "### Face Density\n"
        "- Keep face density even across the mesh — avoid sudden concentration of faces.\n"
        "- Higher density is acceptable near detail areas (face, hands) but transition gradually.\n"
        "- Use the Checker Deselect tool to verify density distribution visually.\n"

        "- **Cycles**: Path-tracing renderer. Physically accurate light simulation. "
        "Slower (minutes per frame) but produces photorealistic results.\n"
        "- Use EEVEE when speed matters or for stylized/non-photorealistic output.\n"
        "- Use Cycles for product visualization, architectural renders, and photorealism.\n\n"
        "### Color Temperature\n"
        "- Warm light (orange/yellow, 2700-4000K): Feels inviting, natural sunsets, interior lamps.\n"
        "- Cool light (blue/white, 5000-7000K): Clinical, daylight, outdoor overcast.\n"
        "- Mix warm key light with cool fill light for cinematic contrast.\n\n"
        "### Shadow Settings\n"
        "- Increase light source size for softer shadows (more realistic for large area lights).\n"

        "subject. Curve it upward at the back (like an infinity cove) for seamless background.\n\n"
        "2. **Add key light**: Add an Area light, position it 45° above and to the right of the "

        "light defining form and shadows.\n\n"

        "at ~2 m distance. Set energy to 500W. The rim light separates the subject from the "
        "background and adds professional depth.\n\n"

        "Cube). This will become the torso. Scale to approximately 0.3 m wide × 0.5 m tall.\n\n"
        "2. **Add mirror modifier on X axis**: With the cube selected, add a Mirror modifier "
        "(Properties → Modifiers → Add Modifier → Mirror). Enable Clipping to prevent vertices "
        "from crossing the center. Delete the right half of the cube in Edit mode — the mirror "
        "modifier handles symmetry automatically.\n\n"
        "3. **Work in edit mode to shape torso proportions**: Enter Edit mode (Tab). Add edge "
        "loops (Ctrl+R) for the chest, waist, and hip regions. Move vertices to create realistic "
        "torso proportions — wider at shoulders, narrow at waist, medium at hips.\n\n"
        "4. **Extrude limbs from torso**: Select the shoulder faces and extrude (E) downward to "
        "create arms. Select hip-side faces and extrude downward for legs. Add edge loops at "
        "joints (elbows, knees, wrists, ankles) for deformation quality.\n\n"
        "5. **Shape head from top vertices**: Select the top face of the torso mesh or add a "
        "separate UV sphere for the head. Scale and position it proportionally — head is roughly "
        "1/7 to 1/8 of total body height.\n\n"
        "6. **Add subdivision surface modifier**: Add a Subdivision Surface modifier at level 2 "
        "for viewport and level 3 for render. This smooths the low-poly base mesh into organic "
        "shapes. Keep the base mesh clean — subdivision magnifies any topology errors.\n\n"
        "7. **Refine edge loops for joints**: In Edit mode, add supporting edge loops near joints "
